# OpenStreetMap
## Overview
This project wrangles and cleans an OpenStreetMap dataset (Nashville, TN) exports it locally to .csv and initializes a local SQL database for exploration. There are four files in the project: *map.osm* (raw data), *schema.py* (schema for SQL database), *OpenStreetMapNashville.ipynb* (JupyterNotebook with overview and code snippets), and *OpenStreetMapNashville.py* (python file).

## Directions
You can view a walk-through of the code by opening *OpenStreetMapNashville.ipynb* in Jupyter Notebooks. To run the python code, download *openStreetMapNashville.py*, *schema.py* and *map.osm* to the same directory and run the code locally.
